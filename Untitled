  The app runs primarily on front-end ReactJS and back-end ExpressJS
  connected to MongoDB. The database is primarily used for storing
  persistent user information such as uploaded vitamin scores.
</p>
<h3>Login via Google</h3>
<p>
  Before gaining access to the system users must sign-in via Google.
  Once signed-in the "Your Health", "Shop" and "Order History" links are
  activated.
</p>
<h3>Your Health</h3>
<p>
  Initially vitamin scores are uploaded. The app expects the same format
  as given in the case study files. Once uploaded, the scores are stored
  in the database and will remain even after logout.
</p>
<h3>Shop</h3>
<p>
  This was mainly implemented so that we can easily create Stripe
  orders. All data is pulled from the Orders API. Products and skus are
  created directly in Stripe. As an example of SKUs, female and male
  versions of the products were created.
</p>
<p>
  Users can create and pay for orders by clicking on any Pay button.
  Because we are integrating with Shippo's test account, please use a
  United States address for shipping if you would like to create a
  successful order.
</p>
<h3>Orders</h3>
<p>
  Once an order is paid for, the user is directed to the orders view.
  The orders view displays the status of the order (paid or fulfilled).
  In order to demonstrate the ability to fulfill orders using the Shippo
  API, the app allows you to view an order and click on the paid status
  in the top right to toggle it to fulfilled. Once fulfilled, a button
  is added to the Order view which links to tracking information.
